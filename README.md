# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors game

I followed along a youtube tutorial, then went back and changed a few elements and added a "rounds" counter and a call for ending after five rounds.
Issues I'm having are the CSS animations don't seem to work, unsure if it's my browser or I'm using outdated syntax?  I'll be going back to this to flesh out
a bit more.
